              <p>
                Welcome to BotNexa ("Company", "we", "our", "us")! As you have just clicked our Terms of Service, please pause, grab a cup of coffee and carefully read the following pages. It will take you approximately 20 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages. Please read it here: <Link to="/privacy-policy" className="text-botnexa-600 dark:text-botnexa-400 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</Link>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy ("Agreements"). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us know by emailing at support@botnexa.com so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.

              <h2>2. Communications</h2>
              <p>
                By using our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.
              </p>
              
              <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
              <p>
                Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or BotNexa cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting BotNexa customer support team.
              </p>
              <p>
                A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide BotNexa with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize BotNexa to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, BotNexa will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
              </p>
              
              <h2>4. Free Trial</h2>
              <p>
                BotNexa may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
              </p>
              <p>
                You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by BotNexa until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
              </p>
              <p>
                At any time and without notice, BotNexa reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
              </p>
              
              <h2>5. Fee Changes</h2>
              <p>
                BotNexa, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
              </p>
              <p>
                BotNexa will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
              </p>
              
              <h2>6. Refunds</h2>
              <p>
                Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
